# Knowledge Bundle Log

## 0.18.3

- Documented native GUI keyboard list navigation and configurable
  `[keybindings]` overrides in `gui.toml`, including default binding names,

  source map.

## 0.15.3

  resolve on session resume, supersede older unread turn rows, and are collapsed
  by visible attention records.

## 0.15.2

- Documented the attention notification debounce window
  (`attention_debounce_secs`), the deferred-create behavior for
  `agent_blocked`/`approval_required` (`created: true` with a minted id, held
  pending until it flushes or is suppressed by an in-window resolve), and its
  relationship to `attention_dedupe_window_secs` in the sessions concept, the
  debug-daemon runbook, and the public API reference.

## 0.14.5

- Documented the durable cross-host notification Inbox, CLI/API surface,
  provider hook requirements, source-priority dedupe, retention, and trust-model
  boundary.

  linked release packaging files from the assistant source map.

## 0.7.0

  assistant source map.

## 0.5.0

  attach delegation, Wayland startup diagnostics, project/worktree method
  boundaries, and secret-handling rules.
- Added native GUI prompt-management guidance covering host-resolved
  prompt/action browse, preview rendering through `crates/prompt`, and

- Linked GUI setup from the knowledge index and source map.

## 0.3.3
